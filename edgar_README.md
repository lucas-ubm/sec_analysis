# EDGAR-CRAWLER: Unlock the Power of Financial Documents üöÄ
![EDGAR-CRAWLER-LOGO](images/edgar-crawler-logo-white-bg.jpeg)

Tired of sifting through endless financial reports of 100+ pages, struggling to extract meaningful insights? 

üìä `EDGAR-CRAWLER` is an open-source & optimized toolkit that retrieves key information from financial reports. It can crawl any report found in the [SEC EDGAR](https://www.sec.gov/edgar.shtml) database, the web repository for all publicly traded companies in the USA.

Most importantly, apart from downloading EDGAR filings like other standard toolkits, `EDGAR-CRAWLER` can also preprocess and convert them from lengthy and unstructured documents into clean and easy-to-use JSON files. 

### `EDGAR-CRAWLER` has 2 core modules:
üì•üï∑Ô∏è Business Documents Crawling: Utilize the power of the `edgar_crawler.py` module to effortlessly crawl and download financial reports for every publicly-traded company within your specified years.

üîçüìë Item Extraction: Extract and clean specific text sections such as Risk Factors or Management's Discussion & Analysis from 10-K documents (annual reports) using the `extract_items.py` module. Get straight to the heart of the information that matters most.

## Who Can Benefit from `EDGAR-CRAWLER`?
üìö Academics: Enhance your NLP research in economics & finance or business management by accessing and analyzing financial data efficiently.

üíº Professionals: Strengthen financial analysis, strategic planning, and decision-making with comprehensive, easy-to-interpret financial reports.

üõ† Developers: Seamlessly integrate financial data into your models, applications, and experiments using our open-source toolkit.

## Install
- Before starting, it's recommended to create a new virtual environment using Python 3.8. We recommend [installing](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/index.html) and [using Anaconda](https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html#creating-an-environment-with-commands) for this.
- Install dependencies via `pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Usage
- Before running any script, you should edit the `config.json` file, which configures the behavior of our 2 modules. 
  - Arguments for `edgar_crawler.py`, the module to download financial reports:
      - `start_year XXXX`: the year range to start from (default is 2021).
      - `end_year YYYY`: the year range to end to (default is 2021).
      - `quarters`: the quarters that you want to download filings from (List).<br> Default value is: `[1, 2, 3, 4]`.
      - `filing_types`: list of filing types to download.<br> Default value is: `['10-K', '10-K405', '10-KT']`.
      - `cik_tickers`: list or path of file containing CIKs or Tickers. e.g. `[789019, "1018724", "AAPL", "TWTR"]` <br>
        In case of file, provide each CIK or Ticker in a different line.  <br>
      If this argument is not provided, then the toolkit will download annual reports for all the U.S. publicly traded companies.
      - `user_agent`: the User-agent (name/email) that will be declared to SEC EDGAR.
      - `raw_filings_folder`: the name of the folder where downloaded filings will be stored.<br> Default value is `'RAW_FILINGS'`.
      - `indices_folder`: the name of the folder where EDGAR TSV files will be stored. These are used to locate the annual reports. Default value is `'INDICES'`.
      - `filings_metadata_file`: CSV filename to save metadata from the reports.
      - `skip_present_indices`: Whether to skip already downloaded EDGAR indices or download them nonetheless.<br> Default value is `True`.
  - Arguments for `extract_items.py`, the module to clean and extract textual data from already-downloaded 10-K reports:
    - `raw_filings_folder`: the name of the folder where the downloaded documents are stored.<br> Default value s `'RAW_FILINGS'`.
    - `extracted_filings_folder`: the name of the folder where extracted documents will be stored.<br> Default value is `'EXTRACTED_FILINGS'`.<br> For each downloaded report, a corresponding JSON file will be created containing the item sections as key-pair values.
    - `filings_metadata_file`: CSV filename to load reports metadata (Provide the same csv file as in `edgar_crawler.py`).
    - `items_to_extract`: a list with the certain item sections to extract. <br>
      e.g. `['7','8']` to extract 'Management‚Äôs Discussion and Analysis' and 'Financial Statements' section items.<br>
      The default list contains all item sections.
    - `remove_tables`: Whether to remove tables containing mostly numerical (financial) data. This work is mostly to facilitate NLP research where, often, numerical tables are not useful.
    - `skip_extracted_filings`: Whether to skip already extracted filings or extract them nonetheless.<br> Default value is `True`.

- To download financial reports from EDGAR, run `python edgar_crawler.py`.
- To clean and extract specific item sections from already-downloaded 10-K documents, run `python extract_items.py`.
  - Reminder: We currently support the extraction of 10-K documents.
